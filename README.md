# Beautiful Mathematica

This repo will include a set mathematical visualizations inspired by my IB Math AA HL class. Special thank you to Mr. Betancourt!
You can test out all the compiled models in the "builds" folder.
## Trigonometry
Trig really has nothing to do with triangles... its all just circles. Here is one demo of the circular illusions brought upon Sine manipulation. The orange ball travels around the purple perimeter, while all the other balls travel on their own axis. Due to the impressive relationship in Sine functions, despite all balls moving back and forth, they form a rotating circle.
